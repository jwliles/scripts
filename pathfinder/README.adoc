== Introduction

*pathfinder* is a powerful command-line tool written in Rust for managing your system's `PATH` environment variable. It simplifies the process of adding and removing directories from your `PATH`, ensures backups are created automatically, and provides tools to restore previous configurations.

Managing the `PATH` variable is crucial for system performance and command execution. *pathfinder* provides a safe and efficient way to handle `PATH` modifications, with features designed to prevent errors and maintain system stability.

== Features

* **Effortless Management**: Easily add or remove directories from your `PATH`.
* **Automatic Backups**: Creates time-stamped backups of your `PATH` before any changes.
* **Restoration**: Restore your `PATH` from any previous backup.
* **Listing**: View all current entries in your `PATH`.
* **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Unix/Linux and macOS systems.
* **Safe Modifications**: Validates directories before adding them to prevent errors.
* **Persistent Changes**: Updates your shell configuration to make changes permanent.

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

* **Rust Toolchain**: Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using link:https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[rustup]:

----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
----

=== Building from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**

----
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinder.git
cd pathfinder
----

2. **Build the Project**

----
cargo build --release
----

This command compiles the project in release mode, producing an optimized binary.

3. **Install the Binary**

Optionally, you can install the binary system-wide:

----
sudo cp target/release/pathfinder /usr/local/bin/
----

Or add it to your `PATH`:

----
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"
----

----

*Options:*

* `--timestamp <timestamp>`: (Optional) The timestamp of the backup to restore. If not provided, the most recent backup is used.

=== Examples

* **Add a Directory to PATH**

----
pathfinder add ~/my/custom/bin
----

* **Remove a Directory from PATH**

- /usr/sbin
- /sbin
- ~/my/custom/bin
----

* **Show Backup History**

----
pathfinder history
----

*Sample Output:*

----
Available backups:
- backup_20231007_120000.json
- backup_20231008_090000.json
----

* **Restore PATH from a Specific Backup**

----
pathfinder restore --timestamp 20231007_120000
----

* **Restore PATH from the Most Recent Backup**

----
pathfinder restore
----

== Configuration

*pathfinder* modifies your shell configuration file to make changes to `PATH` persistent across sessions.

* **Supported Shells**: Bash (`.bashrc`), Zsh (`.zshrc`), or a generic `.profile` if the shell is not recognized.
* **Backup Directory**: Backups are stored in `~/.pathfinder_backups`.

*Note*: Always review changes made to your shell configuration files. *pathfinder* adds an export command to update your `PATH`.

== Backup Management

* **Automatic Backups**: Before any modification, *pathfinder* creates a backup of your current `PATH` with a timestamp.
* **Backup Files**: Stored as JSON files in `~/.pathfinder_backups`.
* **Restoration**: Use the `restore` command to revert to a previous `PATH` configuration.

*Backup File Format Example (`backup_20231008_090000.json`):*

{
  "timestamp": "20231008_090000",
